in the consumers we should check if the queue is empty with a while loop.
if we do it with an if statement we could get null messages because if the
queue was empty and two or more consumer threads were waiting for an message,
one retrieves this element, the other threads will get a null message
because the queue was empty again.

i get this error. after that, the thread who get the error seems to die.
